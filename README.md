The advent of the National Water Model and the development of the Height Above Nearest Drainage products (HAND) offer the ability to map flood extents for anywhere in the lower 48 United States. The challenges with this methodology stem from the acquisition, management and application of large scale data sets. 

FloodMapper is design to help users get the data they need, archive it on their local machines, and then process flood extents. In executing the steps in this process the first time the process in run the data is all collects and formatted - meaning it is slow. After the int ital pass though users can quickly generate flood maps for their region form real-time National Water Model output (getFlows), staged historic data (getRetro), and can adjust forecasted values to test regional sensitivities (adjust). 

This package calls upon the [AOI](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/AOI) and [nwm](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/nwm) packages to forecast flood extents using the HAND methodology and is a continuation of the 'LivingFlood' project demonstrated at the 2017 CUASHI HydroInformatics Conference in Tuscaloosa, AL.
