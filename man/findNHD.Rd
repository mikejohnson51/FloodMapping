\arguments{
\item{AOI}{A Spatial* or simple features geometry, can be piped from \link[AOI]{getAOI}}

\item{comid}{Search for NHD features by COMID}

\item{nwis}{Search for NHD features by NWIS ID}

\item{streamorder}{filter returned NHD by steamorder. Returns are feature of input and higher.}

\item{name}{Seach for NHD by GNIS name}
}
\value{
an sf nhd object
}
\description{
\code{findNHD} returns a \code{SpatialLinesDataframe} of all NHDFlowlines reaches within an AOI.
Data comes from the USGS CIDA server and contain 90 attributes, perhaps most notably:
\itemize{
\item 'comid'   : \code{integer}  Integer value that uniquely identifies the occurrence of each feature in the NHD
\item 'reachcode'   : \code{character}  Unique identifier for a ‘reach’. The first eight numbers are the WBD_HUC8
\item 'fdate': \code{POSITct}  Date of last feature modification
\item 'gnis_id'   : \code{character}    Unique identifier assigned by GNIS
\item 'gnis_name'   : \code{character}    Proper name, term, or expression by which a particular geographic entity is known
\item 'lengthkm'    : \code{numeric}    Length of linear feature based on Albers Equal Area
\item 'areasqkm'    : \code{numeric}    Area of areal feature based on Albers Equal Area,
\item 'flowdir'   : \code{character}     Direction of flow relative to coordinate order.
\item 'wbareacomi'   : \code{integer}  The COMID of the waterbody through which the flowline flows.
\item 'ftype': \code{character}  unique identifier of a feature type
